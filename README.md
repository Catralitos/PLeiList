# PLeiList
An application that allows to manage a catalog of movies and streams, and generate playlists with that content.

I helped develop this app with several colleagues (including Gabriel Freitas, from whom I have forked this repository he set up as an archive) in my time at Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa.
